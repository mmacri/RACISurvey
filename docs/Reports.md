# Reports

Reports translate workshop activity into executive-ready narratives. No vanity charts—only action-driving insights.

## Report types
- **Executive Summary:** what was aligned, what is unclear, what is risky, and what decisions are pending.
- **Conflict Heatmap:** highlights controls with multiple Accountables, missing Accountables, and low-confidence assignments.
- **Gap Register:** severity-ranked list of remediation items with owners and target states.
- **Decision Log:** who decided, what, when, and their confidence level.

## Design principles
- Clear purpose statement at the top of each card.
- Bullet summaries for rapid scan by CIO/CISO.
- Copy explicitly calls out next actions (e.g., “Resolve remaining gaps before export”).

## Export alignment
Reports mirror the downloadable exports so leadership can inspect data before downloading:
- Numbers on cards equal rows in CSV/Excel outputs.
- Each report card describes how to action the insights during follow-up meetings.
