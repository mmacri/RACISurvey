# Styles & Interaction Notes

The visual system is optimized for executive workshops: dark theme, high contrast, and minimal chrome.

## Layout
- Two-column grid: fixed sidebar (navigation + purpose) and flexible main content.
- Cards and panels use consistent radius (12px) and shadow for depth without clutter.
- Responsive breakpoints collapse CTAs and grids for tablet display during workshops.

## Colors
- Background: `#0f172a`; panels: `#1f2937`; accent: `#38bdf8`.
- Status pills map to readiness: green (`#10b981`), yellow (`#f59e0b`), red (`#ef4444`).
- Text favors muted tones for helper copy and brighter white for headlines.

## Components
- **CTA buttons:** primary (accent), secondary (panel), ghost (bordered). All are large-click targets for facilitation.
- **Progress bars:** used on dashboard cards to show completion percentages.
- **Wizard steps:** bordered panels with step-specific copy and back/next actions always visible.
- **Chips:** highlight roles and flags (e.g., Unsure/Disagree) so executives can scan quickly.

## Content tone
- Executive and directive: every paragraph explains the why and the next move.
- Avoid jargon and placeholders; use real verbs like “Resolve,” “Export,” and “Assign.”

## Accessibility
- High-contrast palette and large hit areas to support projected workshop screens.
- Inputs and buttons maintain consistent spacing and focus states via border and background changes.
