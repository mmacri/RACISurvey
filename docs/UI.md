# UI Walkthrough

This UI is purpose-built for facilitators who need to eliminate ambiguity in executive workshops. Every screen states what it is, why it matters, and what to do next.

## Global navigation (left sidebar)
1. Dashboard — landing with purpose banner and primary calls-to-action.
2. Workshops — list view to create, resume, and export sessions.
3. Frameworks — Excel-backed templates you can reuse across governance models.
4. Live Wizard — six-step guided flow that forces clarity.
5. Gaps & Conflicts — consolidated ambiguity that cannot be ignored.
6. Reports — executive-ready summaries and heatmaps.
7. Exports — one-click downloads for all required outputs.
8. Settings — storage and facilitation preferences.

## Executive-friendly patterns
- **No blank states:** every list has seed data and a helper message explaining next steps.
- **Progress visibility:** wizard shows Step 1–6 with context-specific guidance.
- **Actionable language:** cards remind facilitators what to resolve (e.g., conflicts, gaps, unassigned owners).
- **Excel-first:** control cards show their source row to emphasize the canonical workbook.

## Workshop modes
- **Live Workshop:** facilitator drives the wizard in the room; conflicts require resolution or explicit deferral.
- **Async Pre-Work:** stakeholders populate assignments independently; conflicts are highlighted before the live session.
- **Post-Workshop Outputs:** Exports page produces summary, matrix, gap register, and decision log without additional configuration.

## Empty-state guidance
- Dashboard cards always display seeded workshops and a “What to do next” list.
- Gaps view contains helper text to assign owners if no gaps exist yet.
- Frameworks page includes “Use Framework” buttons and a note that Excel remains canonical.
