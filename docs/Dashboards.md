# Dashboards

The landing dashboard is intentionally simple and outcome-oriented so executives know what to do within two minutes.

## Purpose banner
- States the mission: align leadership on ownership, accountability, and gaps.
- Reinforces that outputs are executive-ready and Excel remains canonical.

## Primary CTAs
- **Start New Workshop** — opens the Live Wizard in Step 1.
- **Resume Workshop** — jumps into the most recent workshop context.
- **Run Async Collection** — seeds pre-work mode for distributed input.
- **Generate Executive Pack** — routes to Exports with all outputs available.

## Workshop status cards
Each card surfaces:
- Framework name and progress bar with % complete.
- Open gaps and unassigned owners.
- Readiness status (Red / Yellow / Green) to direct facilitator focus.
- Helper text reminding what to resolve before exports.

## Next steps panel
Explicit “What to do next” list to avoid dead ends:
1. Pick a framework and create a workshop.
2. Collect async inputs or invite participants.
3. Run the live wizard to resolve conflicts and gaps.
4. Export the executive pack.
