# Styles

- Base typography: Inter/ system UI, dark background (#0f172a) with accent green (#22c55e).
- Panels use rounded corners (16px) and border `#1f2937`; inset panels for supporting content.
- Buttons: primary (green), secondary (bordered dark), ghost (dashed). Danger uses red for destructive actions.
- Grid helpers: `.grid.two` and `.grid.three` rely on `auto-fit` to reflow in narrow viewports.
- Wizard layout: `.wizard-grid` defines 3 columns; panels scroll independently to stay in viewport during long sessions.
- Pill selections for scope/roles use `.pill` + `.pill.active` to show toggles.
