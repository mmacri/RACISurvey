# Agent Notes

- Scope: entire repository unless superseded. Keep the Alignment Workshop Engine (AWE) language intact.
- Excel remains canonical. Do not replace with bespoke schemas; only store deltas and metadata locally.
- Favor explicit guidance in copy: every view should state purpose, why it matters, and what to do next.
- Navigation is fixed to the eight primary areas (Dashboard, Workshops, Frameworks, Live Wizard, Gaps & Conflicts, Reports, Exports, Settings).
- Avoid external SaaS calls; keep everything self-hosted and static friendly.
- Prefer small, readable JavaScript without build tooling. Comments should explain facilitator intent, not just code mechanics.
